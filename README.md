# Ancient Greek Colonies Visualisation

## Description

Built a web application using Dash to visualise the number of ancient Greek colonies per its modern-day location. I have also included a table to display the name of each colony for a selected location.

The dataset came from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_colonisation

## Process

Here is an overview of the steps taken:
(1)	The source data – The html structure of the Wikipedia page made it difficult to extract the relevant data using web scrapping techniques. Therefore, I copied and pasted the relevant data in a text document.

(2)	Data wrangling – The GR03A file performed data wrangling tasks on the data imported from the text document and re-organised the data in a table format, suitable for data visualisation purposes. Furthermore, each location was assigned a geo-coordinate in order to position each data point on the map generated by step 3.

(3)	The web application – The GR03B file created the web application (hosted locally), generated an interactive map with its data points using the dataset from step 2 and displayed the table containing city names for the selected location.
